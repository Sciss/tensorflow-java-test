## statement

## requirements / installation

The project build with [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). You may need to edit `build.sbt` to adjust `tfClassifer`.

Furthermore, for Keras models, it currently relies on an unstable version
of [tensorflow-keras-scala](https://codeberg.org/sciss/tensorflow-keras-scala) (bindings). To prepare them, clone
that repository, and within use `sbt +publishLocal` to make an unstable version available to this build.

Then here,

`sbt run`

`sbt 'runMain de.sciss.tf.CnnTest 10 100 sgd'`
